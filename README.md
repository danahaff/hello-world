As I type this, it is 11 degrees Fahrenheit outside.  The cat no longer will go out but cries incessantly at the door.  I spend a lot of   time in a one-sided debate with him about why he doesn't want to go out.  I hope that the urge to be outside will fade before spring.  If not, it will be a very long winter with him.
